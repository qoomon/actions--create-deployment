  reusable-job:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [ 22.x, 20.x ]
    uses: ./.github/workflows/example-reusable.yml
    with:
      # IMPORTANT ensure first value match the surrounding job name
      # IMPORTANT If the surrounding workflow is a reusable workflow itself, append ', ${{ inputs.workflow-context }}'
      workflow-context: '"reusable-job", ${{ toJSON(matrix) }}'
```

##### Reusable workflow
```yaml
on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      workflow-context:
        type: string

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: qoomon/actions--context@v2
        id: context
        with:
          workflow-context: '${{ inputs.workflow-context }}'

      - run: |
          echo "Current Environment: ${{ steps.context.outputs.environment }}"
          echo "Job Logs: ${{ steps.context.outputs.job_log_url }}"
```

#### Release New Action Version
- Trigger the [Release workflow](../../actions/workflows/release.yaml)
  - The workflow will create a new release with the given version and also move the related major version tag e.g. `v1` to point to this new release
